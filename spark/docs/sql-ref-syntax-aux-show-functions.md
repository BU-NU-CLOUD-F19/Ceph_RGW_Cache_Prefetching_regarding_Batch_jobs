### Description
Returns the list of functions after applying an optional regex pattern.
Given number of functions supported by Spark is quite large, this statement
in conjuction with [describe function](sql-ref-syntax-aux-describe-function.html)
may be used to quickly find the function and understand its usage. The `LIKE` 
clause is optional and supported only for compatibility with other systems.

### Syntax
{% highlight sql %}
SHOW [ function_kind ] FUNCTIONS ([LIKE] function_name | regex_pattern)
{% endhighlight %}

### Parameters
<dl>
  <dt><code><em>function_kind</em></code></dt>
  <dd>
    Specifies the name space of the function to be searched upon. The valid name spaces are :
    <ul>
      <li><b>USER</b> - Looks up the function(s) among the user defined functions.</li>
      <li><b>SYSTEM</b> - Looks up the function(s) among the system defined functions.</li>
      <li><b>ALL</b> -  Looks up the function(s) among both user and system defined functions.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><code><em>function_name</em></code></dt>
  <dd>
    Specifies a name of an existing function in the system. The function name may be
    optionally qualified with a database name. If `function_name` is qualified with
    a database then the function is resolved from the user specified database, otherwise
    it is resolved from the current database.<br><br>
    <b>Syntax:</b>
      <code>
        [database_name.]function_name
      </code>
  </dd>
  <dt><code><em>regex_pattern</em></code></dt>
  <dd>
    Specifies a regular expression pattern that is used to limit the results of the
    statement.
    <ul>
      <li>Only `*` and `|` are allowed as wildcard pattern.</li>
      <li>Excluding `*` and `|` the remaining pattern follows the regex semantics.</li>
      <li>The leading and trailing blanks are trimmed in the input pattern before processing.</li> 
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
