 * pruning can be applied.

 * @param buildQuery the build side of the join.
 * @param buildKeys the join keys corresponding to the build side of the join
 * @param onlyInBroadcast when set to false it indicates that the pruning filter is likely to be
 *  beneficial and so it should be executed even if it cannot reuse the results of the

 *  can reuse the results of the broadcast through ReuseExchange
