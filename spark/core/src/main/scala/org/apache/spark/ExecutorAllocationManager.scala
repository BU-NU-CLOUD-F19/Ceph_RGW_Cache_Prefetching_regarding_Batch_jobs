/**
 * An agent that dynamically allocates and removes executors based on the workload.
 *
 * The ExecutorAllocationManager maintains a moving target number of executors which is periodically
 * synced to the cluster manager. The target starts at a configured initial value and changes with
 * the number of pending and running tasks.
 *
 * Decreasing the target number of executors happens when the current target is more than needed to
 * handle the current load. The target number of executors is always truncated to the number of
 * executors that could run all current running and pending tasks at once.
 *
 * Increasing the target number of executors happens in response to backlogged tasks waiting to be
 * scheduled. If the scheduler queue is not drained in N seconds, then new executors are added. If
 * the queue persists for another M seconds, then more executors are added and so on. The number
 * added in each round increases exponentially from the previous round until an upper bound has been
 * reached. The upper bound is based both on a configured property and on the current number of
 * running and pending tasks, as described above.
 *
 * The rationale for the exponential increase is twofold: (1) Executors should be added slowly
 * in the beginning in case the number of extra executors needed turns out to be small. Otherwise,
 * we may add more executors than we need just to remove them later. (2) Executors should be added
 * quickly over time in case the maximum number of executors is very high. Otherwise, it will take
 * a long time to ramp up under heavy workloads.
 *
 * The remove policy is simpler: If an executor has been idle for K seconds, meaning it has not
 * been scheduled to run any tasks, then it is removed. Note that an executor caching any data
 * blocks will be removed if it has been idle for more than L seconds.
 *
 * There is no retry logic in either case because we make the assumption that the cluster manager
 * will eventually fulfill all requests it receives asynchronously.
 *
 * The relevant Spark properties include the following:
 *
 *   spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled - Whether this feature is enabled
 *   spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors - Lower bound on the number of executors
 *   spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors - Upper bound on the number of executors
 *   spark.dynamicAllocation.initialExecutors - Number of executors to start with
 *
 *   spark.dynamicAllocation.executorAllocationRatio -
 *     This is used to reduce the parallelism of the dynamic allocation that can waste
 *     resources when tasks are small
 *
 *   spark.dynamicAllocation.schedulerBacklogTimeout (M) -
 *     If there are backlogged tasks for this duration, add new executors
 *
 *   spark.dynamicAllocation.sustainedSchedulerBacklogTimeout (N) -
 *     If the backlog is sustained for this duration, add more executors
 *     This is used only after the initial backlog timeout is exceeded
 *
 *   spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout (K) -
 *     If an executor without caching any data blocks has been idle for this duration, remove it
 *
 *   spark.dynamicAllocation.cachedExecutorIdleTimeout (L) -
 *     If an executor with caching data blocks has been idle for more than this duration,
 *     the executor will be removed
 *
